# Lab: Using the Azure Portal and SQL Server Management Studio
 
## Lab Overview 

Students will explore the Azure Portal and use it to create an Azure VM with SQL Server 2019 installed. Then they will connect to the virtual machine through Remote Desktop Protocol and use the SQL Server Management Studio. 


## Task 1: Provision a SQL Server on an Azure Virtual Machine 

1. From the lab virtual machine, if you are not already in the portal, start a browser session and navigate to [https://portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com/).

3. On the Create a virtual machine blade, enter the following information: 

	- Subscription: **&lt;Your subscription&gt;**

	- Resource group: **Sql2019**

	- Virtual machine name:  **Sql2019**

	- Region: **West Europe**

	- Availability Options: **No infrastructure redundancy required**
	
	- Image: **Free SQL Server License: SQL 2019 Developer on Windows Server 2019 - Gen1**

	- Azure spot instance: **No**

	- Size: Standard **D2s_v3** (2 vCPUs, 8 GiB memory; you may need to select the "See all sizes" link to see this option)

	- Administrator account username: **your first name**

	- Administrator account password: **Pa55w.rd1234** (or your own password that meets the criteria)

	- Select inbound ports: **RDP (3389)**

	- Would you like to use an existing Windows Server license?: **No**

	Make note of the username and password for later use.

4. Navigate to the Disks tab and review the configuration.

5. Navigate to the Networking tab and review the configuration. 

	![Picture 14](images/dp-3300-module-11-lab-14.png)
 

6. Navigate to the Management tab and review the configuration. 

	![Picture 15](images/dp-3300-module-11-lab-15.png)

	Please leave the auto shutdown optioen enabled at 19:00. If you forget to shut down the VM at the end of the day, it will automatically shut down at 19:00 and save you a lot of money. Understand that this is **not** desirable in a production environment! ;-)


7. Navigate to the Advanced tab and review the configuration. 

	![Picture 16](images/dp-3300-module-11-lab-16.png)


8. Navigate to the SQL Server settings tab and review the configuration. 

	![Picture 17](images/dp-3300-module-11-lab-17.png)

	By default, the SQL Server Azure VM templates create one premium disk with read caching for data, one premium disk without caching for transaction log, and uses the local SSD (D:\ on Windows) for tempdb.

	Reconfigure both data and transaction log disks for 8 GB of disk space. 

	Please notice! If you fail to reconfigure the disks, it will costs you a lot of money since the default size per disk is 1 TB. This might stop you from performing additional exercises.


9. Select the Review + create button. Then select the Create button.

10. On the deployment blade, wait until the deployment is complete. The VM will take approximate 5-10 minutes to deploy. Then select the Go to resource button.

11. On the overview page for the virtual machine, scroll through the menu options for the resource to review what is available.
